# A-013

Welcome to **A-013**, my 2025 personal website.  
This project represents my vision of a neo-futuristic mini-computer designed to showcase my passion for **Frontend Development**, both through its technical complexity and its ultra-realistic visuals entirely crafted in **CSS with Tailwind**.

## About the Project

**A-013** is a unique interface inspired by a retro-futuristic console.  
The goal? To demonstrate my expertise in **React** and **modern CSS**, while creating an immersive and visually striking user experience.

Main Features:
- **Ultra-realistic CSS**: Every element, from the buttons to the cards, has been meticulously designed for a lifelike appearance.
- **Frontend Interactivity**: Smooth and responsive navigation.
- **Designed for Growth**: This project is constantly evolving with exciting future improvements!

## Technologies Used

The **A-013** project was developed using:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): For structure and interactive components.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): For a responsive and elegant design.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic logic and functionality.

## Future Improvements

This project is constantly evolving. Here are some ideas I plan to implement:
1. **Migrating to TypeScript**: For better type management and a more robust codebase.
2. **Interactive Cards**: The cards on the left will become interactive, possibly integrating APIs (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
3. **New Sections**: Adding additional projects or a blog feature.
4. **Enhanced Animations and Transitions**: Enriching interactions with more complex animations for an even more immersive experience.
